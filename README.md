# Multi-Sign-Wallet

A multi-signature wallet, also known as a multi-sig wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires more than one signature or approval to execute a transaction.

This feature increases the security of the wallet by requiring multiple users to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed.

The number of signatures required for a transaction is determined at the time the wallet is set up and can be customized to meet the specific needs of the users.

Multi-sig wallets can be useful for organizations or groups of individuals who want to ensure that their funds are managed in a secure and decentralized manner.
